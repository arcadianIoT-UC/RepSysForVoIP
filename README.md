The tutorial is a result of the ARCADIAN-IoT project (arcadian-iot.eu)


## Requirements

- Java OpenJDK11 
if you aim to compile the application on your system

- Python3
- Pika client to connect to RabbitMQ
- Docker

## Running the code

### Start RabbitMQ and MySQL

```
docker-compose -f docker-composeRedis up

docker run --rm -it \
    -e DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://<IP>:3306/dbAsterisk \
    -e DB_USER=root \
    -e DB_PASSWORD=tutorialRoot \
